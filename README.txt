Here I have part of the code I did for my cs201 class in which I worked with different data structures. Hw4 shows files our professor gave us, where I only modified Program and Array. The others are only the parts me and my partner Sarah coded. The files shown require various other files from the professor to run, but I didn't include them to the repository, since we didn't write them. The final project was the largest assignment and was a weighed map.
